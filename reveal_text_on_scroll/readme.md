# 🎨 Scroll-Pinned Letter-by-Letter Text Color Animation

A stunning scroll-triggered text animation built with **GSAP** and **ScrollTrigger**, where each character **changes color individually** as the user scrolls. The text is **pinned in place**, and a smooth wave of color flows through it — creating a **mesmerizing, modern web effect**.
